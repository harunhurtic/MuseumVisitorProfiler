The Museum Visitor Profiler

🎯 What is it?
Welcome to the repository for Museum Visitor Profiler — a web-based showcase of a questionnaire designed to categorize and profile museum visitors into one of five visitor motivational categories, based on John H. Falk’s Museum Visitor Experience Model.

Try the Questionnaire and the Showcase Here:

🧠 How It Works:
1. Visitors answer a set of 6 questions.
2. Each response is assigned a score and mapped to one of five motivational profiles.
3. The highest-scoring profile is assigned to the user and presented with a corresponding image and description.

The five profiles, based on Falk’s model, are:
1. Explorer
2. Facilitator
3. Professional/Hobbyist
4. Experience Seeker
5. Recharger
   
Scoring is designed to ensure that no two profiles produce the same total score — guaranteeing a unique and consistent result.
